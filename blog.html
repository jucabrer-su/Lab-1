                    As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, 
                    living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

                    It seems to me that each day, thousands of Americans are going about their lives - dropping the kids off at school, driving to work, shopping at the mall, 
                    trying to stay on their diets, trying to kick a cigarette habit - and they're coming to the realization that something is missing.

                    John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded; so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, 
                    he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home.

                    Contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, I have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial 
                    divisions in a single election cycle, or with a single candidacy
